POST /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/issues

Method
POST

Auth
Bearer token

Request
- Path parameters:
  - projectId (string, required): Unique identifier of the project the issue belongs to.
- Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer <token>
  - Content-Type: application/json
- Body (application/json):
  - title (string, required): 1–120 characters. Must be non-empty after trimming.
  - description (string, optional): Free-form text. If omitted, defaults to empty or null (see Notes).
  - labels (array of strings, optional): Zero or more label names. Duplicates will be normalized/removed (see Notes).
  - assigneeId (string, optional): Identifier of the user to assign the issue to. Must reference an active project member (see Notes).

Example request JSON:
{
  ""title"": ""Login form fails on Safari"",
  ""description"": ""Users report a blank page after submitting the login form on Safari 16.5."",
  ""labels"": [""bug"", ""frontend"", ""priority:high""],
  ""assigneeId"": ""usr_9ab32f7c""
}

Response Example (201)
{
  ""id"": ""iss_01J7Y9W8X3K2M4N5P6Q7R8"",
  ""title"": ""Login form fails on Safari"",
  ""description"": ""Users report a blank page after submitting the login form on Safari 16.5."",
  ""labels"": [""bug"", ""frontend"", ""priority:high""],
  ""assigneeId"": ""usr_9ab32f7c"",
  ""createdAt"": ""2025-09-18T14:23:57.842Z""
}

Status Codes
- 201 Created: Issue created successfully. Returns the created issue object.
- 400 Bad Request: Request validation failed. The response body contains error details (e.g., invalid title length, labels not strings, unknown assigneeId format).
- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid bearer token.
- 409 Conflict: An issue with the same title already exists within the specified project (case-insensitive and trimmed comparison).

Notes
- Title validation:
  - Leading/trailing whitespace is trimmed before validation and duplicate checks.
  - After trimming, length must be between 1 and 120 characters inclusive.
- Duplicate detection:
  - Duplicate titles are checked within the same project.
  - Comparison is case-insensitive and ignores extra internal whitespace sequences beyond single spaces.
- Labels:
  - Non-string items are rejected (400).
  - Duplicate labels are deduplicated case-insensitively and returned normalized in creation order.
  - Empty strings or whitespace-only labels are rejected (400).
- Assignee:
  - If provided, must correspond to an existing, active project member; otherwise 400.
  - If omitted or null, the issue is created unassigned (assigneeId is null or omitted in response depending on system conventions).
- Description:
  - May be omitted. If omitted, the server may store and return null or an empty string; clients should handle both.
- Idempotency:
  - Repeating the same request body may still return 409 if the title duplicates an existing issue; use a client-generated idempotency key header if supported by your deployment.
- Timestamps:
  - createdAt is an RFC 3339 UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format.
- Content size limits:
  - Large descriptions may be subject to server-side limits; exceeding limits returns 400.
- Rate limits and permissions:
  - The authenticated user must have permission to create issues in the target project; insufficient permissions return 401 or 403 depending on deployment."
